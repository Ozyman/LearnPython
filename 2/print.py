# A character is a single letter, single digit, single punctuation mark, single space. or something like that.
# A string is bunch of characters all stuck together.
# Usually strings and characters are surrounded by single or double quotes: ' or "
# The python language doesn't think single and double quotes are any different.

# Here are 5 different characters:   'A'  "4"  "&"  '?' "+"
# Here are 5 different strings:  "Paul" "python"  "3+4=5"  "6a2ccs?3wer"  "      +       "


# The print command is used with a string.  It prints that string.
# Can you find the string that this is used with the print command in the next line?
print("Always look on the bright side of life.")

# A special string is the string with no characters at all.  It can be used to print a blank line
print("")

# you can use a variable to store a string
message = "If life seems jolly rotten."

# and then use the variable with the print command and it works the same
print(message)

# we can change the value of the variable
message = "There's something you've forgotten."
print(message)


# now add a line here to set the message to something new, and print it out.
