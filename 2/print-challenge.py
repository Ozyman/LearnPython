# Write a program that meets this requirements:
#
# 1) Print this square(ish) shape to the screen using 4 print statements.
#       +----+
#       |    |
#       |    |
#       +----+
print (" +----+")
print (" |    |")
print (" |    |")
print (" +----+")
# Part 2
#    Once you've done that, modify your program to use variables.
square = (" +----+")
square1 =  (" |    |")
# 3)  Use a variable to store the string that represents the top and bottom of the box.
# 4)  Use a different variable to store the string that represents the sides of the box.
# 5)  Use four print statements that print the value of the variables to display the box.
print (square)
print(square1)
print (square1)
print (square)
#
# Part 3
# Modify your program to print a larger square:
#
print ("+------+")
print ("|      |")
print ("|      |")
print ("|      |")
print ("+------+")
#    
#
#  You can add your code below this line, and then run this python program with the command: "python print-challenge.py"
