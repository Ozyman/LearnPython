# LearnPython
## A set of very simple step-by-step projects for learning Python.

## Introduction
I developed this project to teach Python to Elementary students (ages 8-10).  Each python program introduces one or two topics at a time, and gives the student a chance to experiment with the ideas before moving on to the next program.

## The Lessons
### 1 - hello-world.py
Introduces comments and the ```print()``` function.

### 2 - print.py
Introduces strings, characters and variables

### 3 - ask.py
Introduces the ```input()``` function and concatination of strings.

### 4 - ask2.py
Introduces the ```if``` statement.

### 5 - guess_color.py
Introduces the ```while``` statement

### 6 - spam.py
User defined functions

### 7 - birthday.py
User defined functions with arguments



### tocome
* Bugs and debugging
* Introduce ```import``` and ```random.randint()```
