# LearnPython
## A set of very simple step-by-step projects for learning Python.

## Introduction
I developed this project to teach Python to Elementary students (ages 8-10).  Each python program introduces one or two topics at a time, and gives the student a chance to experiment with the ideas before moving on to the next program.

## The Lessons
### hello-world.py
Introduces comments and the ```print()``` function.

### print.py
Introduces strings, characters and variables

### ask.py
Introduces the ```input()``` function and concatination of strings.

### ask2.py
Introduces the ```if``` statement.

### guess.py
Introduces the ```while``` statement


### tocome
Introduce ```import``` and ```random.randint()```
Introduce user defined functions
