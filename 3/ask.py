# We are going to ask the user a question and put their answer into a variable called name

name = input("What is your name? ")

# we want to say hello, so we take the hello string & add their name to the end of it.
message = "Hello " + name

# then we print it
print(message)

# Try running this program (remember type: "python ask.py" in the shell)

# Can you ask the user another question, and say something in response?
# maybe ask how old they are.  Or where they live.
