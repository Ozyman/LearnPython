# this time we are going to write a function that will take an "argument"

# an argument is a value you give to a function to change it's behavior

# we are going to use a function that prints the words to the happy birthday song.

# it has an argument called "birthday_name", and this is the name of the person
# we are singing to.

def happyBirthday(birthday_name):
    print "Happy Birthday to you."
    print "Happy Birthday to you."
    print "Happy Birthday dear " + birthday_name
    print "Happy Birthday to you."


# now we can call the function:
name = "John Cleese"
happyBirthday(name)

# Can you guess what will happen when you run this program?
# try it out!


# Now can you change this function so that it sings happy birthday
# to someone else?

# Can you modify it again so that it asks the user for their name
# and sings happy birthday to them?
