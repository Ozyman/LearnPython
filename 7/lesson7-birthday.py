# this time we are going to write a function that will take an "argument".
# An argument is a value you give to a function to change it's behavior.

# We define a function that prints the words to the happy birthday song.
# It has an argument called "birthday_name", and this is the name of the person we are singing to.
def printHappyBirthday(birthday_name):
    print "Happy Birthday to you."
    print "Happy Birthday to you."
    print "Happy Birthday dear " + birthday_name
    print "Happy Birthday to you."


# Call the function with a person's name:
name = "John Cleese"
printHappyBirthday(name)

# Can you guess what will happen when you run this program?
# try it out!


# Now can you change this script so that it sings happy birthday to John Cleese first, and then to Eric Idle?



# Next comment out the lines that call the printHappyBirthday() function, and try running the program again.  It should run succesfully, but do nothing.  
# Defining a function doesn't actually do anything unless the fucntion is also called.
# 
# Finally, define a new function called printHB(), which sings a 'text message' version of the song.  Use 'U' in place of 'you', '2' in place of 'to', and 'HB' instead of "Happy Birthday"
# And call it a few times with the names of your friends.
