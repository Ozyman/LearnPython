# This script will:
# 1) Ask a user for a word/phrase
# 2) Ask them how many times it should be printed
# 3) Print the word/phrase that many times.

# After each line of ###############, write the code as described above that line.
# Often times it can be useful to only write part of a program, and then to run the program to make sure it is behaving as expected so far.
# If the line of ########## has (TEST HERE) at the end of it.  You should run the program after that point to see if it is behaving as expected so far.
# Sometimes a test will not look any different after a new line is added, if the line does not produce output, but if it runs without an error, that is a succesful test at that point!

# First ask the user for the word/phrase and store it in a variable using the input() function  
# Picking a descriptive name for the variable makes it easier to understand the program as you are writing it and later when you or someone else has to read it.
# In python variables are usually all lower case, and if they are more than one word, they use a '_' to separate the words.  e.g.  my_beautiful_variable = "hello"
################################## (TEST HERE)


# Now ask the user for the number of times it should be printed, and store that in a different variable
################################## (TEST HERE)


# input() returns a string, but to do arithmetic we need to convert to an integer
# use int() to convert the last variable to an integer, and store it in a new variable.
################################## (TEST HERE)


# A while loop will be used to count the number of times the phrase is printed, and keep looping until we print enough.
# First create a variable to keep track of the number of times we've printed it so far.  Set it to zero to start, because at this point we've printed zero times
################################## (TEST HERE)


# Next write a while statement.  The condition in the while statement should check if the number of times we've printed so far is less than the 
# number of times we want to print.
##################################


# In the body of the while loop (don't forget to indent), we need to do two things.
# First thing we do is print the phrase from the user
# ################################

# Next we need to add one to our count that is keeping track of the number of prints.
# if your variable is called dustin_henderson (a great name for a person, a bad name for this variable), you would say:
# dustin_henderson = dustin_henderson + 1
##################################


# That's it.  You can now run your program and see if it works!
