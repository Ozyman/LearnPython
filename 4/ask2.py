# We are going to ask the user a question and put their answer into a variable
favorite_color = input("What is your favorite color? ")


# Now we want to respond in different ways depending on how the user answered our question.

# If they like blue, we tell them it's our favorite also
if favorite_color == "blue":
    print("That's my favorite too!")
# otherwise we tell them we prefer blue 
else:
    print("I prefer blue.")

# Can you add responses for other colors?
# Can you ask the user another question, and say something in response?
# maybe ask how old they are.  Or if they like some TV show or what their favorite movie is.
