# Let's put together what you learned about 'if' statements.
# We are going to make a quiz to help people learn state capitals.
# Follow along with the comments below, adding code below each comment that does what the comment says.

# Create two variables that hold the name of a state and it's capital.
# Just call the variables 'state' and 'capital'.
# You can use any state & capital you want.

# Create a new variable called 'question'.  Make it a string that asks the user to enter the capital of the state. 
# Use the 'state' variable when you create the question instead of typing the name of the state again.

# Ask the user the question (use the input() function), and store the answer in a variable called 'capital_guess'.

# Compare the 'capital' and 'capital_guess' variables, and tell the user whether they got the answer right or not.

# Now run the program and see if everything works the way you expect.


#
# Once you get that program workign satisfactorily, use the tripe-quote blocks to comment out the entire program above, and you are going
# to write another similar program below with less help.

# This time ask the user to guess a number between 1 and 10. 
# Have a secret number that you want them to guess.
# Test to see if they guessed correctly, and tell them if they got it correct or not.
