# This is a file that tells the computer what to do.

# The computer understands many different languages, but they are not English, Chinese or other human languages.

# This file uses a language called "Python" to tell the computer what to do.

# In the python language, any line that begins with a "#" is called a comment.

# Comments don't tell the computer to do anything - they are just there to explain things to people, not computers.

# So far this file is just comments, and so it doesn't tell the computer to do anything.

# Here comes a command to the computer.  We are going to tell it to print the words "Hello World!" to the screen.
print("Hello World!")

# That's all this program does.  All the comments don't do anything.

# Try to run this program from the shell, you tell the computer what language it is in like this:
# python hello-world.py

# Try and type that into the shell and see what happens....

# then come back to this window.

# Did it print "Hello World!" to the screen?  If so, congratulations, you just ran your first computer program.
#
#
# This is a very simple program, 


# Now, try to change this file to have it say hello to a particular person.
# Instead of "Hello World", have the computer print "Hello Paul", or a different name.

# After your change, make sure to save the program, and then run the program again from the shell, like this:
# python hello-world.py

# Did it work?  Did you change the message?  Can you have the program print something else?
# It doesn't have to be "hello".
