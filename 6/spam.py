# code is often organized into functions.  A function is a little bit of code
# that can be reused over and over.  It's given a name, and you just use the
# name of the function to make the program run the code that is in the function.

# You can identify functions, because they have parenthesis when they are used.
# We've used two functions so far.

# The first was print()
# The second function we used was input()

# let's remember how those work

# See if you can figure out what these next two lines will do, then
# run this program and see if you were correct.
name = input("Please enter your name: ")
print("Hello " + name)


# python has lots of functions you can use, but you can also write your own function.
# The "def" line defines the name of the function.
# After the name each line of the function is indented to show that it belongs to the function
def spam()
  print("Lovely spam! Wonderful spam!")
  print("Lovely spam! Wonderful spam!!!!!")


# now that we've written that function, we can "call" the function.
# try uncommenting this line to see what it does

# spam()

# try calling the function several times, to see that it calls the function each time.
