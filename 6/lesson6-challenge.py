# In this lesson you will use the randint() function from the random library to simulate a roll of dice.
# This program should ask the user how many dice to roll, then print the results of the roll (individual dice and a total).

# Although it's not required to put import statements at the beginning of a file, that is a common place for them.
# We know we will need the random library, so import it here.

# The first thing to do is ask the user how many dice to roll. Use input() and store their answer in a variable.

# Now create another variable to keep track of how many dice have been rolled so far.  At this point none have been rolled, so initialize it to zero.

# Another variable will keep track of the total of all dice rolls.  We also initialize this variable to zero.

# A while loop can be used to keep rolling dice while the number of dice rolled is less than the requested number.

# Inside the while loop use random.randint(1,6) to get a random number between 1-6 and store that in a variable.

# Print the dice roll

# And add it to the total.

# That's everything that needs to happen in the while loop.


# Once all the dice have been rolled, print the total.
